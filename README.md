Python on Maqueen Plus with Micro:bit

There are quite a few types of Maqueen robots:

* Maqueen Lite - https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1783.html
* Maqueen Plus - http://wiki.robotmc.be/index.php/Bestand:MaqueenPlus1.jpg
* Maqueen Plus V2 - https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2487.html

This repo is aimed at the (now obsolete) Maqueen Plus (not V2). A distinct feature of this robot are quadrature encoders on the motors. It has an 18650 battery holder on the main board.
